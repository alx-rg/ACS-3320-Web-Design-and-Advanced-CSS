# Assignment 1 - CSS Zen Garden

Your goal for this assignment is to style the CSS Zen Garden page. 

The trick to this assignment is that you can not edit the HTML file. You must apply all of your styles using the existing HTML. 

## What will you learn?

The goal is not to make the most amazing looking page, though you can do that if you want. The real goal is to learn to apply styles to the elements on the page by using a wide range of selectors. 

Since you can't change the page to add new class or id names, or rearrange the markup to fit your ideas you will forced to find ways to implement your ideas using the CSS language alone. 

But why do that? The CSS language is powerful. To understand it you must use it in new ways. Doing this asssignment will force you to use a wider range of selectors and look for new ways to apply CSS properties. 

## Reuirements 

You will style the CSS Zen Garden page. You can not edit the HTML. 

### Strategies 

You may be thinking but I'm not a deigner how will I do this? Here are two strategies you can choose: 

1. Make the page read well and present it's information as best it can. Don't think about art or design, don't try and page look fancy, just worry about how well it reads. Imagine that CSS Zen garden is a product and you are trying to inform people about this product. 

Try borrowing ideas and styles from pages like these: 

- https://reactjs.org
- https://www.fedex.com/en-us/home.html
- https://github.com
- https://www.nytimes.com
- https://www.apple.com

None of these is very "arty" don't worry about it. Just make the information read well. Look at what the Zen Garden page says, read the text. Think about how it's organized. Then work with the goal of making those ideas easy to understand. 

2. You feel inspired and want to express your creative ideas. Go for it! Do whtever you like.
