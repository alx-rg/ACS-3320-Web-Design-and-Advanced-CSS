# Redesign a previous project

Your goal is to redesign one of your previous projects. Use the CSS concepts and ideas from class. 

## Getting started

The first step is to take a screenshot or two of the original project before you have made any changes. Save these screenshots to the project repo. Submit links to these images on GradeScope. 

## Challenges!

- Update the typography - Use a system font or a custom font. Be sure to set the line-height and base font-size. 
- Use background images - Use icon images to enhance buttons and other UI elements. Use gradients, or repeating images for backgrounds or edges. Use backgrounds for dividers or accents. 
- Improve the layout - Use flex box and grid where applicable. 

If you are choosing a site that used Bootstrap take the challenge to redesign the site without Bootstrap. You can try recreating all of the styles used in a Bootstrap site and change the things that you don't like.
