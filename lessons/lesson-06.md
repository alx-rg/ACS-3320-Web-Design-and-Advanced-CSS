## Review

Consider this exercise as a practice interview question. There are two parts: an on site question and a take home question. The take home question is at the bottom of this page [here](#after-class). 

Imagine you need to design a dashboard page for a new product. This page is divided into a grid. Below is an image showing what the final page might look like. 

Grid Challenge: 

![grid challenge](images/grid-challenge.png)

Your goal is to recreate the image above with the markup below. Imagine this as a coding interview. 

Follow these steps: 

- Think about the problem and formulate at least one question for the interviewer. Your question should help clarify the problem and focus the expectation. 
- Outline your solution with comments. Think of this as Pseudo coding your solution! Review your pseudo code with the interviewer before coding! 
- Code your solution. 

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Dashboard</title>
  <style>
    
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="dashboard">
    <h1 class="title">Dashboard</h1>
    <div class="monster grid-cell">Monster</div>
    <div class="welcome grid-cell">
      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Some text... </p>
    </div>
    <div class="parents grid-cell">
      <h2>Parents</h2>
      <p>Some text... </p>
    </div>
    <div class="customize grid-cell">
      <h2>Customize</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="level-up grid-cell">
      <h2>Level Up</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="play grid-cell">
      <h2>Play</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
  
</body>
</html>
```

## Use the Framework

Each framework has its systems and paradigms. For the most part, they will work in this way: 

- You will link to a stylesheet you may also have the option to include a JS file. 
- Linking to the stylesheet will add a set of default styles that cover the common tags like:
 - Base font and typography
 - Headings
 - Links
 - Lists 
 - Tables 
 - form elements

The framework will offer more styles and custom elements that are created by using a combination of markup/HTML and class names. 

- Navbars
- buttons
- cards
- other features...
