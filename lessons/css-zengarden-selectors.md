# CSS Zen Garden Selector Challenges

The goal of these challenges is to practice with selectors. Think of it like a game. You goal is to apply styles to elements of the CSS Zen Garden page by writing the selector for that element. 

You can not edit the CSS Zen Garden HTML, you have to find selectors that will work from the existing HTML. 

Why do this? Imagine you are working on a future project and need to make a change in the page. 

The first solution will often require modifying the existing HTML markup. This may not be your best solution if you can make the change by modifying your CSS alone. A good understanding of selectors and the DOM will allow you to assess and formulate better solutions.
